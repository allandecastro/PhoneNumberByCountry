To use Microsoft PowerApps CLI, do the following:

* Install Npm (comes with Node.js) or install Node.js (comes with npm). We recommend LTS (Long Term Support) version 10.15.3 LTS as it seems to be most stable.

* Install .NET Framework 4.6.2 Developer Pack.

* If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 or later, follow one of the options below:

  * Option 1: Install Visual Studio 2017 or later.
  * Option 2: Install .NET Core 2.2 SDK and then install Visual Studio Code.
* Install Microsoft PowerApps CLI.

Be sure to update your Microsoft PowerApps CLI to the latest version: 
```bash
pac install latest
```
